# Description
![Philosophers Diagram](pictures/setting.jpg)

This project is about implementing a solution to the classic philosphers dining problem.
We have a few philosophers sitting around a circular table.
Between each pair of philosophers lies a spoon.
To eat, a philosopher must hold two spoons — one in each hand.
In the middle of the table is the shared limited food.

#### How can we schedule spoon usage so that no philosopher starves?

The key to solving the Dining Philosophers is to ensure two properties simultaneously:

- No deadlock: the system always makes progress — no philosopher is stuck forever waiting.
- No starvation: every philosopher who wants to eat will eventually get a turn.

### Why this matters

The philosphers dining problem refers to the classical synchronization problem in an operating system and illustrates the issue when mutiple threads or processes access shared resources in memory without coordination.

Without careful design, competing threads can fall into:
- deadlocks:  All threads wait forever for resources held by others.
- Racecondition: unpredictable behaviour of variables in common

This problem is a well-known synchronization challenge in concurrent programming, used to illustrate how multiple threads can share resources safely without conflicts.

## Usage

```bash
./Philosophers n t_die t_eat t_sleep must_eat
```
### Arguments
- ```n```       number of philosophers and forks
- ```t_die```   time in ms that past after the last meal. After that duration a philospher will starve to death.
- ```t_eat```   time in ms that a philosopher needs during eating
- ```t_sleep``` time in ms that a philosopher needs during sleeping
- ```must_eat```number of times each philosopher should eat atleast

Output:
```
time_past | i-philosopher | state of a philosopher(thinking, eating, grabing or sleeping)
```
    
### Example
```./Philosophers 5 400 200 200```

Output:
```
0 0 is thinking
0 0 has taken a fork
0 0 has taken a fork
0 0 is eating
0 1 is thinking
0 1 has taken a fork
0 2 is thinking
0 3 is thinking
200 0 is sleeping
200 3 has taken a fork
200 3 has taken a fork
200 3 is eating
200 1 has taken a fork
200 1 is eating
401 0 is thinking
401 0 died
```

## How does it work

#### Resource‐Hierarchy Strategy

Number the spoons and philosophers from 0 through n – 1 clockwise.
Each Philosopher can reach two spoons: on the right or left side.
Each Philosopher should pick up the right spoon first, then the left spoon.
If another philosopher is already holding the right or left spoon, he waits until it is available.

In the following animation we have 4 philosophers and 4 spoons. Each philosopher picks up the right spoon first, then the left spoon. If a philosopher is already holding the right or left spoon, he waits until it is available. This strategy prevents in many cases deadlocks because at least one philosopher will be able to eat and release the spoons, allowing others to eat as well. As a result, first all even numbered philosophers will eat, then all odd numbered philosophers will eat, and so on. This way, no philosopher will starve and the system will make progress. 

![4 Philosophers ](https://github.com/WaPoco/Philosophers/blob/main/philo-demo.gif)

One possible way to implement the solution is by using mutexes and threads from the library ```thread.h```. 
A thread is the smallest execution unit which the CPU can process and would represent a philosopher.
On the other hand the spoons could be represented by mutexes which are kind of locks. ....
## Tests
1.Test: No dataraces, deadlocks
```valgrind --tool=helgrind ./Philosophers ...```

2.Test:

```./Philosophers 1 800 200 200```
