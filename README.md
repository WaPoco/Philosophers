## Philosophers problem

This project is about implementing a solution to the classic philosphers dining problem.
We have a few philosophers sitting around a circular table.
Between each pair of philosophers lies a spoon.
To eat, a philosopher must hold two spoons ‚Äî one in each hand.
In the middle of the table is the shared limited food.

#### How can we schedule spoon usage so that no philosopher starves?

The key to solving the Dining Philosophers is to ensure two properties simultaneously:

- No deadlock (every system of requests eventually makes progress)
- No starvation (every philosopher who wants to eat eventually gets to eat)

### Why this matters

The philosphers dining problem refers to the classical synchronization problem in an operating system. If we have more than one thread and shared memory the synchronization problem arises. The philosophers dining problem illustrates the issue when mutiple threads access shared resources in memory without coordination.

Potential problemes:
- deadlocks:  All threads wait forever for resources held by others.
- Racecondition: unpredictable behaviour of variables in common

The philosphers dining problem is used to teach mutex exclusion...

In our assignment the philosphers suppose to follow a routine:

1. Think

2. Eating

3. Sleeping

4. Repeat 1


For my implemention I am going to use threads and mutex locks from the library `pthread.h`. Each philosopher will be assigned to a thread and spoon to a mutex lock.

## How does it work

1. Resource‚ÄêHierarchy (Numbering) Strategy

Number the spoons from 0 through n‚Äì1 (in a circle).
Always pick up the lower‚Äênumbered spoon first, then the higher‚Äênumbered one.
Philosopher i sees two spoons: spoon i (on the right) and spoon (i+1)%n on the left.
- If i < (i+1)%n he grabs spoon i first;
- otherwise he grabs spoon (i+1)%n first.
